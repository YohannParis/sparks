  <h1>Tests for Sparks</h1>

  <p>
    Here is some text with a tiny chart in it so that we can test how Sparks works on the web,
    just like this <span class="sparks dotline-extrathin">123{0,100,10,90,20,80,30,70,40,60,50}987</span> right here.
    There will often be many words in a paragraph, so here I will continue typing until there is a sufficiently large text block.
    Sometimes the words will be good, and sometimes they will be bad.
