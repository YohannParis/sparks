# Sparks design and build process

### Design

Sparks was drawn in Robofont (1.8.4), though a considerable amount of work was done to the dot-line UFO files in a text editor.

Due to the nature of the dot-line chart glyphs, once the primitives were drawn most of the work to create the full glyph set was done by directly editing the contents of the UFO files with a text editor. Some fancy find-and-replace was enough to create the glyph list (which is part of lib.plist) and the actual `.glif` files were generated by a [Python script](https://github.com/aftertheflood/sparks/tools/glif_file_generator.py) generously written by Owen Praeger.

### Build

All of the fonts were processed with ufonormalize and then output from Robofont. (Output of OTF files for the dotline UFOs takes a *long* time, i.e. 10 minutes per file.) The webfont files (woff, woff2, eot, svg) were generated using the [Batch](https://github.com/typemytype/batchRoboFontExtension) plugin. After generation all fonts were checked with OTS.
