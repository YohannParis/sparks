  Sparks is a typeface for creating sparklines in text. It uses OpenType's <b>contextual alternates</b> feature to perform simple replacement operations on numbers and works without Javascript, though it does require a modern-ish web browser that can make use of OpenType features in text.   There are currently three variations: **bars, dots, and dot-lines** (line charts with tiny dots at the joints between segments), each of which has five weight variants.
</p>
  All three of the variants use a fixed scale of 0â€“100. If you're data only goes to e.g., 10, you'll need to first translate your numbers to be out of 100, otherwise you'll end up rendering an especially tiny chart.
</p>
<p>
  Sparks takes strings like `123{30,60,90}456` and outputs a sparkline. The example of `123{30,60,90}456` would have with three datapoints of 30, 60, and 90 framed by 123 and 456. Spaces after the commas will prevent the numbers from being transformed. Numbers outside of the brackets are never transformed.
